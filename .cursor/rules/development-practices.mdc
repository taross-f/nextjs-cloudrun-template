# Development Practices

## Package Management

- Use Bun as the primary package manager
- Fall back to pnpm if needed (Docker builds use pnpm)

## Git Workflow

- Do not commit directly to main or master branches
- Create feature branches for all changes
- Submit Pull Requests for code review
- Use the GitHub CLI (`gh` command) for GitHub operations

## Code Standards

- Write all README files, code comments, and commit messages in English
- Run ESLint before committing code: `bun lint`
- Follow existing code style and conventions in the project

## Testing

- If tests fail twice in a row, stop and organize the current situation
- Avoid repeated trial and error without a clear hypothesis
- Work together to find a solution

## Communication

- Ask questions when instructions are unclear
- Use Slack and MCP for reporting work progress
- Always include in reports:
  - List of completed tasks
  - List of questions requiring answers
  - List of items to be reviewed (e.g., GitHub PR URLs)
